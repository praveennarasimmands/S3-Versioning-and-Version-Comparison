# S3 Versioning and Version Comparison

## **Problem Statement**

In the domains of **Media & Entertainment**, **Legal**, and **Education**, content and documents undergo frequent revisions. Keeping track of these revisions while ensuring that earlier versions are not lost or overwritten is a critical requirement. For instance, in:
- **Media & Entertainment**: New versions of video files, audio recordings, and images are uploaded regularly.
- **Legal**: Contracts and legal documents evolve over time, requiring an ability to track, compare, and retrieve prior drafts.
- **Education**: Course materials and textbooks are often updated, with instructors needing access to previous versions.

The challenge lies in:
1. **Tracking Versions**: Managing and storing multiple versions of the same file.
2. **Avoiding Data Loss**: Preventing accidental overwrites of important files.
3. **Comparing Versions**: Providing a way to compare different file versions to analyze the changes.

## **Solution Overview**

We will leverage **Amazon S3 Versioning** to solve this problem. S3 Versioning allows us to automatically store multiple versions of an object in a bucket, helping us track changes and prevent data loss. Additionally, we will implement an automated **Version Comparison** system using Python and the Boto3 library to allow users to compare different versions of files stored in S3.

### **How We Will Solve This:**

1. **Enable S3 Versioning**: We will configure an S3 bucket to enable versioning, ensuring that every file modification creates a new version instead of overwriting the existing file.
2. **Compare Object Versions**: We will write a Python script that lists all versions of a given object and compares their metadata, allowing users to identify differences between versions.
3. **Provide Easy Integration**: The code will be structured in a modular way to integrate easily with various domains, such as **Media & Entertainment**, **Legal**, and **Education**, where frequent updates to files are common.

## **Features**

- **S3 Versioning**: Automatically enables version tracking for files in S3 buckets.
- **Automated Version Comparison**: Compares multiple versions of a file to help analyze changes.
- **Cross-Domain Applicability**: Works for Media & Entertainment, Legal, and Education files, ensuring broad usability across industries.
- **Simple Python Scripts**: Easy-to-use scripts that can be executed to enable versioning and compare versions directly.

## **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Enable S3 Versioning**
- We use the **Boto3 Python SDK** to enable S3 versioning on a specific bucket. Versioning ensures that every time a file is uploaded or modified, it is stored with a unique version ID.

### **Step 2: Version Comparison**
- Using another Python script, we will list all versions of an object stored in the S3 bucket and compare their metadata (such as `LastModified` and `VersionId`) to track changes between versions.
- We will also print out information about the versions, such as when the version was created, making it easy to spot changes.

### **Step 3: Integration with Various Domains**
- The solution will be applicable across different domains by simply applying it to the corresponding S3 buckets and objects. We will manage video files for Media & Entertainment, legal contracts for Legal teams, and course materials for Education.
